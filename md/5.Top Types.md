# Top Types and Bottom Types

## Set Theory

Types describe set of allowed values

```typescript
// set of all booleans - true and false
let a: boolean

// set of all numbers
let b: number
```

## Top Types

A top type is a type that contains all possible values

{x | x could be anything}

TypeScript allows two types: `any` and `unknown`

`any`

same rules as if in JavaScript

```typescript
let a: any
a = 1
a = 'hello'
a = true
```

issues

```typescript
let a: any = 14
a.foo.bar // no error
```

`unknown`

values of type `unknown` same as `any` but you need to type guard before using them

```typescript
let a: unknown = 30
let b = a === 123 // boolean

a.foo.bar // error, need to type guard it
```

## Bottom Types

`null`, `void`, `undefined` are bottom types

`.!` means that an object that might be `null` or `undefined` is not

Types that can hold no possible value / no possible value allowed by the system

`never`

Useful for exhaustiveness conditions

```typescript
class Car {}
class Truck{}
type Vehicle = Car | Truck;

function getVehicle(): Vehicle {
  return new Car();
}

const vehicle = getVehicle();
if (vehicle instanceof Car) {
  // vehicle is a Car
} else vehicle instanceof Truck {
  // vehicle is a Truck
} else { // NEVER here
  // vehicle is neither a Car nor a Truck
  const neverValue: never = vehicle;
}
```

Guards if anyone adds a new vehicle type, in this case `var: never` will throw

Can use `UnreachableError`:

```typescript
class UnreachableError extends Error {
  constructor(val: never, message: string) {
    super(message);
  }
}
```

## `is` Type Guard

```typescript
class FileSystemObject {
  isFile(): this is FileRep {
    return this instanceof FileRep;
  }
  isDirectory(): this is Directory {
    return this instanceof Directory;
  }
  isNetworked(): this is Networked & this {
    return this.networked;
  }
  constructor(public path: string, private networked: boolean) {}
}
```
